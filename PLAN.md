# Plan

To build a web application that includes the following features
- [x] Login
- [x] Sign Up
- [x] View Profile
- [x] Logout
- [x] Delete Account

The site should be secured as follows
- [ ] Accessed through HTTPS
- [ ] Upon login, user session should be maintained through a token stored in session cookie
- [x] Passwords should be hashed, salted and peppered (using bcypt function)

## Future Use
This project will stand as the foundations for any of my future projects that require users to have an account.
